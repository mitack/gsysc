  HOWTO use different languages with gSysC
============================================

With Qt it's possible to use different languages without the need of recompiling your graphical interfaces.
gSysC is prepared for this feature. Available are the German (standard) and English language.

To use another than the German language in your gSysC dialoges, copy the appropriate language file
(gsysc_<LANG>.qm) into the directory your SystemC-design is placed.

Because Qt switches the language dynamically with the language your environment is adjusted to, the LANG 
environment variable has to be set to an appropriate LANG-abbreviation. This means for German "de", for English "en",
for French "fr", and so on.

For example to use English language without switching the language of your console environment, start your compiled
SystemC-design with the command
	LANG="en" run
(Assuming 'run' is the binary created through compiling your design.)


To create a new language file, follow the steps:
1) add your language file to the gSysC project file gsysc.pro in the section TRANSLATION in the form gsysc_<LANG>.ts
2) run the command (for safety backup your other ts-files!)
	lupdate gsysc.pro
3) run the QLinguist GUI-tool to translate all found strings of gSysC to your new language
4) run the command
	lrelease gsysc_<LANG>.ts
   to create a qm-file out of your completely translated ts-file. This file will be used in your design.
