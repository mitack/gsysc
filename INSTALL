==   Adjustments to the Makefile                                     ==
=======================================================================

Please adjust the header of the Makefile to your system. This means
the paths, where SystemC and Qt can be found have to be adjusted.

Afterward the library can be compiled with simply using the make command.
No parameter is needed for this.




=======================================================================
==   In your project ...                                             ==
=======================================================================

Just add the gSysC path, where file 'libgsysc.a' is placed,
to the library path searched by your compiler.

Additionally to this, edit your project files to include 
the file 'gsysc.h'.

After this, gSysC should be usable with your project.
